# What is KSwitch?
**KSwitch** is a native desktop application designed to bridge the gap between Android devices and Linux desktops. While Windows and macOS users enjoy official tools like Samsung Smart Switch™, Linux users are often left behind.

KSwitch solves this by providing a **GUI-based**, lightweight, and privacy-focused backup solution built with **Kotlin Compose Multiplatform**.

Unlike other tools, KSwitch is **Agentless**: it works purely via ADB (Android Debug Bridge) and does not require installing any suspicious APKs on your phone. It uses advanced internal queries to replicate the "Smart Switch" experience — categorizing your data, preserving directory structures, and backing up installed applications.

# Features

### Core Capabilities:
- **🐧 Linux Native:** Built for KDE/GNOME. No Wine, No Electron, No Heavy VMs.
- **⚡ Smart Scanning Engine:** Uses direct `ContentProvider` queries (like the official tool) to find media in milliseconds, skipping recursive folder scanning.
- **🔌 Agentless Architecture:** Just enable USB Debugging. No root required.
- **📂 Structure Preservation:** Mirrors your phone's directory tree exactly on your PC for easy manual access.
- **📝 Manifest System:** Generates a `backup_manifest.json` for every session, tracking every file transfer for reliability.
- **🌗 Dark Mode:** Professional UI designed for modern Linux environments.

### Backup & Restore Support:
- **🖼️ Media:** Images, Videos, and Music (Categorized).
- **📱 Installed Apps:** Automatically extracts and backs up `.apk` (installer) files of user apps.
- **📦 Archives & Docs:** Smart detection for `.zip`, `.rar`, `.pdf`, `.docx` and more.
- **👥 Contacts:** Exports phone contacts to standard `.vcf` format.
- **📞 Call Logs:** Dumps call history to `.xml` for safekeeping (Backup only).

# 🔮 Roadmap & Future Plans
KSwitch is just getting started! Since the project is built with **Kotlin Multiplatform**, expanding to other OSs is the next logical step.

Here is what I am working on:
- [ ] **Cross-Platform Support:** Native versions for **Windows** and **macOS**.
- [ ] **Wireless Transfer:** Backup over Wi-Fi (no cable needed).
- [ ] **UI/UX Overhaul:** More fluid animations and deeper customization.
- [ ] **Incremental Backup:** Backup only new or changed files to save time.

> **Note:** Porting to other platforms and adding complex features takes time and resources. Your support accelerates this process!

# Installation

### Debian / Ubuntu / Linux Mint and others
Download the latest `.deb` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Zyren-Lab/KSwitch/releases).

- `sudo apt update`
- `sudo apt install adb`
- `sudo dpkg -i kswitch_1.0.0-1_amd64.deb`

### Fedora / RedHat / CentOS and others
Download the latest `.rpm` from the [Releases Page](https://github.com/Zyren-Lab/KSwitch/releases).

Support the Development
KSwitch is developed by a solo developer to make the ecosystem better for everyone.
Building native tools for Linux (and soon Windows/Mac) requires significant time and effort.

If you want to see the Windows/Mac versions sooner, or if this tool saved your data, consider buying me a coffee! It keeps the code flowing. ☕
